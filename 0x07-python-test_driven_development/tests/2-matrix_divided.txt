The ``2-matrix_divided`` module


Using ``matrix_divided``


This is the "matrix_divided" function in the "2-matrix_divded" module divides all elemnts of a matrix by a specified number

# Test 1: Dividing a matrix by 3
>>> matrix = [
	[1, 2, 3],
	[4, 5, 6]
    ]

>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 3)
[[0.33, 0.67, 1.0], [1.33, 1.67, 2.0]]

# Test 2: Dividing a matrix by 2
>>> matrix = [
	[4, 8, 12],
	[6, 10, 14]
    ]
>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 2)
[[2.0, 4.0, 6.0], [3.0, 5.0, 7.0]]

# Test 3: Dividing a matrix by 0
>>> matrix = [
	[1, 2, 3],
	[4, 5, 6]
    ]
>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 0)
Traceback (most recent call last):
	...
ZeroDivisionError: division by zero

# Test 4: Matrix with rows of different sizes
>>> matrix = [
	[1, 2, 3],
	[4, 5]
    ]
>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 2)
Traceback (most recent call last):
	...
TypeError: Each row of the matrix must have the same size

# Test 5: Matrix with non-numeric elements
>>> matrix = [
	[1, 2. 'a'],
	[4, 5, 6]
    ]
>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 2)
Traceback (most recent call last):
	...
TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats
