**BRIEF INTRODUCTION**

Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-orirnted programming (oop) that allows one class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class.
This promotes code reuse and establishes a relationship between classes, where one class, called **`The Child`** or **`Derived Class`** , inherits attiributes and methods from another class, known as `The parent or Base class`.

To create a derived class in Python, You use the following syntax:
	class DerivedClass(BaseClass):
	    #additional attributes and methods

The super() function is used to call a method from the parent class. I is often used in the derived class to invoke the constructor or methods from the base class

In Python, a class can inherit from more than one base class, this is called **`Multiple Inheritance`**.
This allows a class to have attributes and methods from multiple sources.
