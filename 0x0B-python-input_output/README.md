This is ALX Python - Input/Output project

**BRIEF INTRODUCTION**

Python Input/Output (I/O) refers to the process of exchanging data between a program and the external world, which can include user input, files, and other devices.
Understanding how to handle I/O operations is fundamental to building robust and interactive Python applications.


**STANDARD INPUT AND OUTPUT**
Here, we have 
* Reading from the console: 
Here, you can use the 'input()' function to read user input from the console. The 'input()' function takes a prompt as an argument, displays it to the user, and waits for them to enter data.

* Writing to the console:
Here, the 'print()' function is used to display output on the console. It can take multiple arguments and concatenate them with a space by default. You can also specify the separator and end characters.
